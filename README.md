> Welcome to the repository for my website! This site is a rework of my previous website with a markdown based blog. I made this website with an intention of implementing the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), which is a web development convention that focuses on better performance, higher security, easier scaling, and an overall better developer experience!
