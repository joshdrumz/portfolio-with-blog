## Introduction

Hello, world! (Seen this phrase too much at this point haven't you! ðŸ˜‚)

First of all, let me extend my gratitude and thanks for spending time to visit my website!
It's always been an interest of mine to share my thoughts and efforts with the world.
Most of my content on this blog will cover programming related subjects, as well as my learning journey
to what eventually led to me booking my first software engineering job. While I will acknowledge that I
gained a lot of good knowledge and experience from my undergraduate Computer Science degree, I ultimately 
found my passion of software development through self-learning. I'm excited to share the platforms and resources
I used to learn what I know today.

## History

My first introduction to programming was in high school when I saw a thumbnail on YouTube that caught my attention.
It was a video entitled "Learn Java in 45 minutes" I believe. Of course, a title like this is pretty ridiculous as 
you certainly could not learn an entire programming language in such a short period of time. Regardless, it fascinated me 
that a computer could be completely under your control through the power of code (relatively speaking).
Most people still think that computers know everything and are extremely smart. In reality, computers are actually really
stupid and only understand 0's and 1's, in other words, what the user TELLS it to do.

I initially went to college for a degree in Music Education. I've been playing drums for most of my life.
Feel free to check out my one and only [drum cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elh7AgjanM8) (warning: LOUD SCARY METAL MUSIC).
I eventually plan to make more with better recording equipment in due time.
While I love music and playing (and still do), I only ended up doing one semester of ME. This is the point in my life
where I took a gamble to experiment with a CS degree. Midway through my CS degree, I started realizing how important it
was to experiment and learn new technologies that my school wasn't teaching. I made several [projects](/) with the latest
web technologies and frameworks that really helped build out my resume into something I was proud of. Keep reading to 
learn what resources I used the most to help me land a remote software engineering position shortly after graduating
college!

## Resources I Used

- **YouTube** - I'm nearly convinced that the common phrase, "You can learn anything on YouTube", holds some truth to it.
  YouTube is without a doubt my #1 resource for anything programming related. There are so many great people (**not companies**)
  that are generally making content that helps people change their life through code. Later on in this post, I'll recommend some channels that inspired me on this platform.
- **Udemy** - Udemy is also a great platform for learning programming. It's a course website where users can upload classes on
  specific topics for a price. Most of the time, these courses are heavily discounted with a coupon code provided by the course
  instructor (found either on their YouTube channel or other various social media platforms).
- **LeetCode** - I primarily used LeetCode to practice my technical interviewing skills. It's also a great website to brush up
  on your algorithm and data structure knowledge in preparation for a software engineering interview.

## YouTube Channel Recommendations

- [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) - Brad was the first channel that inspired me to create my own projects
with the help of his examples. He primarily covers web development related tutorials (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, JS frameworks), but recently has employed the help of other content creators to upload programming related content for other languages (such as C++, Python, Kotlin, etc.). He occasionally makes fantastic motivational videos as well. Brad also uploads exclusive course content 
to Udemy for a very low price.
- [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) - Sentdex is a content creator who uploads programming related videos with       Python. His Django web framework series helped to get me started on building and deploying the first rendition of my personal portfolio website. I also used his Linode coupon code to help pay for the first four months of my webserver!
- [Coding Garden](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw) - CJ is a great person to learn from on YouTube.
He also streams on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden) regularly. He primarily creates content on Vue.js, a JavaScript frontend framework (competes with React and Angular). I personally fell in love with Vue.js after watching a lot of his livestreams and YouTube videos. The website you are visiting right now was created with Vue.js.

I'm sure there are many other YouTube channels I have visited in the past to learn new technologies. I will continually update this post with new channels that I come across as I still enjoy learning new frameworks and languages!

## Conclusion

Thank you once again for taking the time to read this post and visit my website! Feel free to keep exploring my blog posts for
tutorials on the technologies that I have discussed in this post! Please [contact me](/contact/) for any inquiries or questions!
