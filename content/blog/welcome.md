## Introduction

Hello, world! (Seen this phrase too much at this point haven't you! ðŸ˜‚)

First of all, let me extend my gratitude and thanks for spending time to visit my website!
It's always been an interest of mine to share my thoughts and efforts with the world.
Most of my content on this blog will cover programming related subjects, as well as my learning journey
to what eventually led to me booking my first software engineering job. While I will acknowledge that I
gained a lot of good knowledge and experience from my undergraduate Computer Science degree, I ultimately 
found my passion of software development through self-learning. I'm excited to share the platforms and resources
I used to learn what I know today.

## History

My first introduction to programming was in high school when I saw a thumbnail on YouTube that caught my attention.
It was a video entitled "Learn Java in 45 minutes" I believe. Of course, a title like this is pretty ridiculous as 
you certainly could not learn an entire programming language in such a short period of time. Regardless, it fascinated me 
that a computer could be completely under your control through the power of code (relatively speaking).
Most people still think that computers know everything and are extremely smart. In reality, computers are actually really
stupid and only understand 0's and 1's, in other words, what the user TELLS it to do.

I initially went to college for a degree in Music Education. I've been playing drums for most of my life.
Feel free to check out my one and only [drum cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elh7AgjanM8) (warning: LOUD SCARY METAL MUSIC).
I eventually plan to make more with better recording equipment in due time.
While I love music and playing (and still do), I only ended up doing one semester of ME. This is the point in my life
where I took a gamble to experiment with a CS degree. Midway through my CS degree, I started realizing how important it
was to experiment and learn new technologies that my school wasn't teaching. I made several [projects](/) with the latest
web technologies and frameworks that really helped build out my resume into something I was proud of.
