Hey there! Welcome back to my blog. In this post, I'd like to share my journey of landing my first software engineering job a few months after graduating college with my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.

## Why I Didn't Get an Internship

You may have just read the title above and wondered how in the world I was able to snag a position in the software engineering field without any internship experience. Many professors and colleagues heavily encourage their students to interview for an internship early in their college career. While this is advise I wish I'd taken, I did not during my time in college. I did participate in several interviews for an internship, but I did not realize that I was doing it all wrong. There were several things that I had to learn from experience (**such as interview rejections**). While it is certainly easier to land a full-time software engineering job with prior internship experience, it's obviously not impossible to get one without it. People nowadays are landing jobs at Google without a college degree. Never say never!

## Building Side Projects is Important

If you didn't have time to read this whole blog post, please at least read this section. I cannot stress enough how important it is to start building your own codebases, projects, websites, open source contributions, robots, etc. There are several advantages to doing this:

> 1. Learning new technologies that your university might not teach
> 2. Finding your passion for a specific subfield of software engineering
> 3. Making your resume stand out
> 4. Improving your skills as a college student
> 5. Learning to learn

### Learning new technologies that your university might not teach

My university used Java as an introductory programming language for the first courses you must take as a computer science student. While Java is still heavily used today, Python is out-growing Java in terms of use cases in the real world and also happens to be a wonderful programming language to teach as a introductory language. This could be one reason why you'd want to learn new technologies, such as TypeScript or Vue. You might never get the chance to expand your library of knowledge in terms of technology while attending university.

### Finding your passion for a specific subfield of software engineering

Personally, I found my passion for full-stack web development through building side projects such as my portfolio website. I've met other college students who found their passion in machine learning, web design, data analysis, game development, database administration, etc. The primary method for finding your passion is by building something that peaks your interest. Do you like playing video games and are interested in how they are developed? You can go on YouTube and find a programming tutorial on how to create a Flappy Bird clone with Python. The possibilities are limitless as far as learning technology goes.

### Making your resume stand out

Of the many mistakes I've made in my job search, one of them was that I had no side projects to show off on my resume. Employers want to know if you've taken the extra leap in learning and can prove your skills. Building projects in a classroom setting is great, but it's almost more impressive to see a candidate with their own projects their own resume that proves that they've taken free time out of their regular university schedule to learn new technologies. Let's assume you're applying for a job as a front-end developer that requires knowledge of React. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a website built with React to show that employer that you know that framework?

### Improving your skills as a college student

Building side projects is a fantastic way to improving your skills as a software engineer. You'll run into errors and bugs during your time developing your side projects. This is exactly the kind of experience you'll find in the real world. As you continue to build, you'll eventually find the solution through extensive googling, therefore improving your skills as a college student. This also provides advantages for your future group projects or finals at university. By learning how to handle errors, you'll find yourself remembering that one Windows system path environment variable error during a time of need!

### Learning to learn

Let's face it. Technology is ever-changing. You might know React front-to-back, but then five years later Svelte becomes the new standard for front-end web development and React has become obsolete (in terms of finding a job). During your entire career as a software engineer, you must accept the fact that you'll be learning new things all of the time. Building various side projects will help you "learn to learn". 

## Connections

After building your side projects and putting them on your resume, it is extremely beneficial to gain connections in the industry. Find an old study buddy, a friend from high school, or a friend of a friend that has experience in the field or currently works as a software engineer. These people can help you land a job at their company or companies they've worked at before, or give you constructive criticism on your resume. In my opinion, making a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile is a great way to do this. Recruiters use LinkedIn religiously to find candidates to fill a position at the company they represent. Depending on how you setup your profile, recruiters will message you directly regarding an availability and you can setup a time for a phone call or video chat. I nearly landed a position at KPMG (one of the ["Big Four" accounting firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms)) due to a recruiter contacting me on LinkedIn and peaking my interest! I found this [article](http://www.theconversioncompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LinkedIn-Profile-Guide.pdf) to be quite useful during my time setting up my personal LinkedIn profile.

## Conclusion

Overall, building side projects and gaining valuable connections is extremely beneficial to increasing your chances of finding a job as a entry-level software engineer right out of college. I encourage you to research technologies that interest you and build something with it! It will provide endless benefits for you and your career!
